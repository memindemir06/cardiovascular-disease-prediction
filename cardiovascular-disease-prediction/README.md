# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict cardiovascular diseases using machine learning models. 

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `data/raw`: Contains the raw data for the project.
- `data/processed`: Contains the processed data that is ready for analysis.
- `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb`: Contains the exploratory data analysis.
- `src/data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for preprocessing the raw data.
- `src/feature_selection.py`: Contains functions for selecting features from the processed data.
- `src/model.py`: Contains the machine learning model for predicting cardiovascular disease.
- `src/utils.py`: Contains utility functions that are used across the project.
- `tests/test_model.py`: Contains tests for the model.
- `models`: Contains the trained machine learning models.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.

## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis.
4. Run the Python scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess the data, select features, and train the model.
5. Run the tests in the `tests` directory to ensure the model is working correctly.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the Jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis.
2. Run the Python scripts in the `src` directory to preprocess the data, select features, and train the model.
3. Use the trained model in the `models` directory to make predictions.
